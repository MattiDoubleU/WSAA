This is the project for the 2025 Web Services and Applications (WSAA) module. A description of the project can be found [here](https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/pluginfile.php/1496651/mod_resource/content/15/WSAA%20Project%20Description.pdf).

Initially, I was going to do a project on aviation but struggled to find usable datasets that were free of charge. [Cirium.com](www.cirium.com), the world's most trusted source of aviation analytics for example provides top notch datasets, unfortunately none of them available for simple download. Same goes for [Iata](www.iata.org), International Air Transport Association or [CH-Aviation](https://www.ch-aviation.com), a subscription-based platform that provides accurate and reliable data and news on operators, aircraft, airports, and more.
